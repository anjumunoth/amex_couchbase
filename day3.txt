Replication queue or disk queue -- dependent on durability
Durability : off or none (actibe vbucket); majority; majority and active persist; majority persist

1. Durability : majority ;RF : 2; majority :2
write query --> execute the query on vbucket(memory) and one of its replica vbucket(memory) --> ack sent to client --> async -- stored in disk

2. Durability : majority persist
write query --> majority(memory and disk)--> ack sent to the client

3. Durability : majority and active persist
replicate in majority of replicas and persist the active vbuckets
Both the queues
